                    <p>InfoTech WNY brings you our annual winter intersession IT Shadowing Program.
                    We are currently in the process of identifying local companies/IT professionals who are
                    willing to allow students to shadow an IT staff member throughout the day on either
                    January 7 or 8, 2016. We have chosen the intersession so you are able to spend the entire
                    day to get a more complete view of a 'day-in-the-life'. Remember, a shadow day is NOT an internship, but a chance to learn and explore a career by observation.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since  this program is open to all students from infoTech WNY member schools, there are many more students than companies; therefore, we are only allowing students to participate in one shadow day (unless the supply outweighs the demand).
                        We strongly recommend students become members of infoTech WNY as well. Students benefit from membership in infoTech WNY by attending educational seminars, company tours and networking events. They receive our e-newsletter and can participate in focused usergroups. Learn more and become a member at www.infotechniagara.org/student-membership.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Steps to Participate:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Register! Preference is given to those who register early, i.e. one month prior to the Shadow Day.</li>
                        <li>Be as specific as possible in your registration form as the shadow opportunity you are matched with is determined by your answers on the registration form.</li>
                        <li>Wait to be contacted by the Shadow Program Administrator to see who has selected you, or where with which sponsor you have been matched. This process takes place all throughout December and sometimes early January. The program administrator will contact you if more information is needed from you.</li>
                        <li>Once you are matched, you will receive an email with pertinent information (i.e. sponsor contact, location, etc.) Reach out to your shadow contact to introduce yourself.</li>
                        <li>Prepare for your shadow day experience: research the sponsor, prepare questions for the professionals you shadow. We will provide a guide when we inform you of your assigned shadow sponsor.</li>
                        <li>Shadow!</li>
                        <li>Send a professional thank you letter to all those at the sponsor who let you interview and shadow them.</li>
                        <li>Promptly complete the evaluation we send you.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Keep an open mind! We are limited to however many shadowing opportunities become available by companies and will attempt to match as many students as possible. However, there is no guarantee each student will be assigned to a shadow opportunity or be matched with one of your top three requests. If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

                    <p>
                    There is no guarantee each student will be assigned to a shadow opportunity. The program will do its best to identify companies and IT professionals for each willing student participant.
